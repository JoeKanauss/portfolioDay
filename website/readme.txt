**************************************
Need fixed ASAP
**************************************
----HOME PAGE----
NO image or scan lines on the home page
o make it white
• back up font to Proxmina nova: Roboto google font (not all computers have
Proximina as it didn’t appear on some of the school computers on campus)

----STUDENT AREA----
• NO flashing border

----STUDENT INFO----
• the animation and doesn’t always show up, check on school computers
it needs to be “Graphic Design” not “graphicDesign”
• I assume the none is from the second degree, but it needs to go
• if there are two programs, format like so: “Graphic Design, Photography” - aka, same
line, comma + space separating them
• we want the links to actually say what they are, not just “Email me”- I for one HATE
when sites have the email me thing, I don’t use mail, I hate it I won’t use it, I’d rather
copy paste the email from the site, but I can’t even see the email this way. same goes
for the website link - I want the url not just a link. Linkedin is fine the way it is
though, leave that one alone
• what is “My Resources”? why is it there? don’t need it. delete it
• the “X” to close this window doesn’t work

*****************************************
FIX Soon
*****************************************
----Home Page----
• since the homepage is very bland could you format it like so ^
o basically, just move everything up and get rid of the “What is MIX?” title
▪ probably the tab for it as well since it’s all kinda the same page this way
o the phone layout would stay the same as it now but without the “What is
MIX?” title

----STUDENT AREA----
• the entire image area should be clickable - including the part with the name 

----STUDENT INFO----
• the photo: centered please, both vertically and horizontally.
also, don’t need the black background on the X, as long as it’s seeable it works,
most everyone knows there’s almost always an x in the upper right corner of
pop ups
• please refer back to previous layout for how we want the layout displayed on the
student bio - I have it attached again for reference, please ask if you don’t understand
or need help with part of it (The text should be white though)

*****************************************
fix last
*****************************************
----NAVBAR----
• When the Nav bar hits 2 lines, center them and shrink the line height a bit - maybe
even have less space between the options


----WHAT IS MIX----
• pink text - keep it over by the map like before, we liked that just make sure it doesn’t
get hidden behind the map when resized
• we liked this page from before - please bring it back

----STUDENT AREA----
• move video students down
o photography - pink
o web - yellow
o video - orange (use the orange from the mix logo specs sheet - under the
secondary colors)
• is there a way to “zoom out” of the dog photo so it’s not as close up? (still want it the
same image size but the dog is very large compared to the people) 

----STUDENT INFO----
• can we make the background gradient the color of the main program -
o design would be purple to pink
o photography would be pink to yellow
o web would be yellow to orange
o video would be orange to yellow

----FOOTER----
• social media icons - when rolled over, they do like a bounce or something that causes
a lag between the original to the one with a white outline/black symbol - can we get
rid of that bounce/lag in there
• why is everything in bold? use regular; titles of the area can be bold, but the
underline is not needed
• “Des Moines Botanical Gardens, IA” can be split between 2 lines for more uniformity
with centered text: split like soo
“Botanical Gardens
o Des Moines, IA
